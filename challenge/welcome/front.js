WAhhhh so you've come to see 'under the hood'!?

Welcome!
You can actually find out more about me too.

Use the object 'getToKnowBo' to communicate with me. Just set the getToKnowBo.answer property to send in your answers.

For every question you solve you will get a word/phrase.
You can use that later to jump to the task skipping all the previous ones by calling
> getToKnowBo.jumpTo(keyword);

First question: are you ready?

Type: getToKnowBo.answer="yes" to get started! :)
